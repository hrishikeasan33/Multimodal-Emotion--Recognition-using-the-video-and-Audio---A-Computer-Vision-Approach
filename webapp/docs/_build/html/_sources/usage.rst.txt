Usage
=====

Installation
------------

To use the recognizer, first clone the repository: https://github.com/wintechis/emotion-detection-and-reaction.git
In the IDE of your choice, open the top folder of the now local repository.
Create a new interpreter and install the necessary libraries using the requirements file:

   (.venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    
The environment should then be ready.

Tutorial
--------

Start the server by executing the app.py file. It takes up to 2 minutes to start the server.

   (.venv) $ python app.py

It is then reachable from your favorite web browser on localhost: https://127.0.0.1:5000/
You are redirected to the landing page index.html. Make sure your microphone and webcam are connected and not used by other applications. The recognizers in the background start as soon as you select one of the working modes in the Navigation pane or buttons on the main page.
The about page gives more details about the underlying models and used datasets.
